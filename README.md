# [Handy commands](https://github.com/FarisHijazi/handy-commands)

Here are the commands that I save because I'll likely use them later. Also includes some of my linux-setup commands.


## Index

- [linux-setup.md](linux-setup.md): Includes most of the commands I run on a fresh linux install
- [ffmpeg-audio.md](ffmpeg-audio.md): parallel processing using ffmpeg
- [handy-commandline.md](handy-commandline.md): random command line stuff like hashing directories or anything I'll be using more than once
